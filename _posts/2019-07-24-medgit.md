I have built a working prototype of a github-like service for version control in medical research. 
It is intermittently hosted at [https://proto.med-git.org](https://proto.med-git.org). I have written a medium post on the idea [here](https://link.medium.com/DnS2EILBAY).

If the website is down and you would like to try it - please do contact me (see below) and I would be more than happy to spin it up.
